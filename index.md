I am currently a student of the Master of Science in Computer Engineering program at New York University, US. Previously, I have completed Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Southeast University, China. 

I possess robust knowledge in AI-related fields where I learned systematically as my major, as well as sufficient project experiences covering AI applications, data analyzing and Python development with proficiency in languages like Python, C++, Linux, and Java, as well as tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. My keen interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and algorithms, where I constantly strive to improve results by integrating state-of-art models. Additionally, I am also skilled in database management across SQL and NoSQL environments and big data frameworks. Recently, I am exploring more in the distributed system to keep myself open to up-to-date technologies. 

In the practice of diverse projects, I have mastered the ability to quickly self-study and communicate nice and efficiently with teams. Apart from my deep interests for my profession, I also like table tennis and other sports, dancing, reading, and piano. These hobbies greatly enrich my spiritual world and energize me. I wish to use and learn technical skills to make contributions to the real-world.



我本科毕业于东南大学人工智能专业，研究生就读于美国纽约大学计算机工程专业，因此我在具备人工智能与数据方面的深入性外，还对计算机技术的理解具有全面性。我擅长与团队成员沟通合作，且通过不断接触新技术培养出了较快的自学能力。我乐于将论文中的先进模型运用到实际项目中，以及分析数据以分析其中蕴含的深层信息。除专业技能外，我还具备良好的中英文写作和沟通技能，爱好广泛，擅长乒乓球等体育运动，热爱读书，写作，钢琴与舞蹈等。
